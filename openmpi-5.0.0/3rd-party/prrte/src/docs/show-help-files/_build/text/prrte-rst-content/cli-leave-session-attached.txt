Do not discard stdout/stderr of remote PRRTE daemons. The primary use
for this option is to ensure that the daemon output streams (i.e.,
stdout and stderr) remain open after launch, thus allowing the user to
see any daemon-generated error messages. Otherwise, the daemon will
"daemonize" itself upon launch, thereby closing its output streams.
