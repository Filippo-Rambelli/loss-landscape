Export an environment variable, optionally specifying a value. For
example:

* "-x foo" exports the environment variable "foo" and takes its value
  from the current environment.

* "-x foo=bar" exports the environment variable name "foo" and sets
  its value to "bar" in the started processes.

* "-x foo*" exports all current environmental variables starting with
  "foo".
