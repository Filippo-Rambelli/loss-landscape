Redirect output from application processes into
"filename/job/rank/std[out,err,diag]". A relative path value will be
converted to an absolute path. The directory name may include a colon
followed by a comma-delimited list of optional case-insensitive
directives. Supported directives currently include "NOJOBID" (do not
include a job-id directory level) and "NOCOPY" (do not copy the output
to the stdout/err streams).

Deprecated: This option is deprecated.  Please use "--output
dir=<path>".
