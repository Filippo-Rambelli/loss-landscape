The "--bind-to-core" option
===========================

Bind each process to its own core.

Deprecated: This option is deprecated.  Please use "--bind-to core".


The "--display-allocation" option
=================================

Display the allocation being used by this job.

Deprecated: This option is deprecated.  Please use "--display alloc".


The "--display-devel-allocation" option
=======================================

Display a detailed list (mostly intended for developers) of the
allocation being used by this job.

Deprecated: This option is deprecated.  Please use "--display alloc-
devel".


The "--display-devel-map" option
================================

Display a detailed process map (mostly intended for developers) just
before launch.

Deprecated: This option is deprecated.  Please use "--display map-
devel".


The "--display-map" option
==========================

Display the process map just before launch.

Deprecated: This option is deprecated.  Please use "--display map".


The "--display-topo" option
===========================

Display the topology as part of the process map (mostly intended for
developers) just before launch.

Deprecated: This option is deprecated.  Please use "--display topo".


The "--gmca" option
===================

Syntax: "--gmca <key> <value>", where "key" is the parameter name and
"value" is the parameter value. The "g" prefix indicates that this
parameter is "global", and to be applied to *all* application contexts
— not just the one in which the directive appears.

Pass generic MCA parameters — i.e., parameters whose project
affiliation must be determined by PRRTE based on matching the name of
the parameter with defined values from various projects that PRRTE
knows about.

Deprecated: This translation can be incomplete (e.g., if known project
adds or changes parameters) — thus, it is strongly recommended that
users use project-specific parameters such as "--gprtemca" or "--
gpmixmca".


The "--mca" option
==================

Syntax: "--mca <key> <value>", where "key" is the parameter name and
"value" is the parameter value.

Pass generic MCA parameters — i.e., parameters whose project
affiliation must be determined by PRRTE based on matching the name of
the parameter with defined values from various projects that PRRTE
knows about.

Deprecated: This translation can be incomplete (e.g., if a project
adds or changes parameters) — thus, it is strongly recommended that
users use project-specific parameters such as "--prtemca" or "--
pmixmca".


The "--merge-stderr-to-stdout" option
=====================================

Merge stderr to stdout for each process.

Deprecated: This option is deprecated.  Please use "--output merge"


The "--output-directory" option
===============================

Redirect output from application processes into
"filename/job/rank/std[out,err,diag]". A relative path value will be
converted to an absolute path. The directory name may include a colon
followed by a comma-delimited list of optional case-insensitive
directives. Supported directives currently include "NOJOBID" (do not
include a job-id directory level) and "NOCOPY" (do not copy the output
to the stdout/err streams).

Deprecated: This option is deprecated.  Please use "--output
dir=<path>".


The "--output-filename" option
==============================

Redirect output from application processes into "filename.rank". A
relative path value will be converted to an absolute path. The
directory name may include a colon followed by a comma-delimited list
of optional case-insensitive directives. Supported directives
currently include "NOCOPY" (do not copy the output to the stdout/err
streams).

Deprecated: This option is deprecated.  Please use "--output
file=<path>"


The "--report-bindings" option
==============================

Display process bindings to stderr.

Deprecated: This option is deprecated.  Please use "--display
bindings".


The "--tag-output" option
=========================

Tag all output with "[job,rank]".

Deprecated: This option is deprecated.  Please use "--output".
