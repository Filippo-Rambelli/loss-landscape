Redirect output from application processes into "filename.rank". A
relative path value will be converted to an absolute path. The
directory name may include a colon followed by a comma-delimited list
of optional case-insensitive directives. Supported directives
currently include "NOCOPY" (do not copy the output to the stdout/err
streams).

Deprecated: This option is deprecated.  Please use "--output
file=<path>"
